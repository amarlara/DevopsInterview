1) WebServer Vs AppServer
   WebServer - static html pages, only HTTP requests
   AppServer - Dynamic html pages, HTTP + other requests
2) RUN vs CMD
   RUN - command triggers while we build the docker image.
   CMD - command triggers while we launch the created docker image.
3) maven life cycle
4) Jenkins continue on failure
5) pipeline run from a specific stage   
6) How ansible tower connects to a host
7) DOCKER VS VIRTUALIZATION
8) SSH VS SSL
9) How SSL works
10) free style vs pipeline
   The difference is that in Pipeline we have the ability to break our jobs out into different stages and we can have whatever stages we'd like to represent the process we use to deploy software and of course,
   if anything goes wrong, we can see which stage had the problem; 
   for example. We even have the ability to add in verification before we proceed.
   We have the ability to run stages in parallel so we could have multiple tests executing in separate branches very easily.
